Changes for 0.2-0 (2022-11-25)
   * blrm: added support for cmdstan and cmdstanr package using backend=
   * When using cmdstan uses bayesplot package for pairs plots
   * stanDx: new code for cmdstan diagnostics
   * stackMI: corrected erroneous implementation of file= where it was only applying to one of the imputations; also handled generally the conversion of functions in fit object to character strings for efficient serializing

Changes for 0.1-0 (2022-04-12)
   * blrm: got around bug in model.response not keeping class Ocens
   * soprobMarkovOrdPost: removed since Hmisc has soprobMarkovOrdm
   * lrmconppot.stan: removed redundant pi simplex (thanks Mark Jones <mark.jones1@sydney.edu.au>

Changes for 0.0-2 (2021-02-27)
   * Removed @title lines from Roxygen comments
   * Enhanced predict.blrm and changed prediction methods to use it
   * Changed storage of cppo function in fit object to character strings so as to not have saveRDS serialize it with all its environment data
   * Added lrmconppot.stan to implement flat and t-distribution priors for intercepts
   * blrm: added iprior argument for lrmconppot
   * predict.blrm: fixed fun= with finint=FALSE
